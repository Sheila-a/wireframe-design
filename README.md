This project is a simple app with wireframe design created from Helicarrier React Developer interview. It shows a view of a mock dataset I created using graphql-faker; an ....... . The mock dataset is grouped by their date of creation and can be filtered by their types or status of data with specified filter components. They can also be searched through with a search box
